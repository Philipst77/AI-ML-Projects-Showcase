# 🍷 Wine Classification using Decision Trees

This project demonstrates how to classify wine data using Python and Decision Trees. It includes loading a dataset, exploring it using visualizations, and training/testing a Decision Tree classifier to observe how model depth affects overfitting.

## 🔍 Objective

- Load and explore the wine dataset from `scikit-learn`
- Visualize feature distributions using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
- Train and evaluate Decision Trees with different depths
- Understand overfitting through accuracy comparisons

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Utilize `scikit-learn` for building Decision Tree classifiers
- Use `pandas` and `seaborn` for data manipulation and visualization
- Understand the relationship between model depth and generalization

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3 and the following packages installed:

pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run

python3 script.py
