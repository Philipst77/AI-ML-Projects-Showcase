# Know Your Data: Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

This repository contains a hands-on walkthrough of **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** techniques applied to real-world health and anthropometric datasets. The goal is to understand the structure, distributions, and relationships within the data using statistics and visualization.

Two datasets are used:
- **Diabetes dataset**: Medical measurements used for diabetes prediction.
- **Height-Weight dataset**: Human height and weight data for distribution and correlation analysis.

## üß† Data-Driven Approach

This project simulates a practical EDA workflow:
1. **Data Loading & Structure Inspection**  
   Explore the shape, data types, and summary statistics.

2. **Univariate & Bivariate Visualization**  
   Generate scatter plots and histograms to visually examine distributions.

3. **Correlation Analysis**  
   Identify relationships between variables using correlation heatmaps.

4. **Multivariate Distribution Comparison**  
   Use KDE and ChainConsumer to analyze joint distributions by group.

5. **Insights & Reporting**  
   Summarize key patterns and relationships discovered during exploration.
