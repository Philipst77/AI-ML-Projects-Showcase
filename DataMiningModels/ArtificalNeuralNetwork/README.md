# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project implements a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict customer churn based on a given dataset.

## Overview

The script trains an ANN using a provided churn dataset to classify whether a customer is likely to leave the bank. After training, the model is used to predict churn for a new customer based on specified features.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow or Keras
- (Optional) Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

Install required packages with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
