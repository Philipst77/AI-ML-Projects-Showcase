# ðŸ§  Customer Churn Prediction with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project implements a machine learning model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn in a banking environment. By analyzing customer attributesâ€”such as demographics, financial metrics, and account activityâ€”the model identifies patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to leave the bank.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Project Does

This end-to-end pipeline includes:

- ðŸ”„ **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
  Reads a structured dataset of bank customers, performs data cleaning, encodes categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Geography), and scales numerical features to prepare the data for training.

- ðŸ§  **Model Architecture & Training**  
  Defines a deep neural network using Keras with multiple dense layers, optimized for binary classification (churn vs no churn). The model is trained on a labeled dataset with a train/test split to evaluate generalization.

- ðŸ“Š **Performance Evaluation**  
  Assesses the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data using accuracy, loss, and prediction metrics. You can optionally generate a confusion matrix or classification report for further insight.

- ðŸ”® **Churn Prediction for a New Customer**  
  After training, the model is used to make a real-time prediction on a new customer based on a provided feature set.
